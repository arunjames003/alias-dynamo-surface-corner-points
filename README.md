## Installation / Usage

1. **Download the script**
   - Navigate to the repository.

   - Navigate to **Transform → Dynamo Player** to open the Dynamo Player interface.  
     Dynamo Player lets you run scripts without opening Dynamo directly—it loads the inputs and parameters defined in your `.dyn` file automatically.
   - In the Dynamo Player, click the **browse** icon next to **Script Location**, then locate and select the file named:
     ```
     Surface from 3 or 4 Corner Points.dyn
     ```

   - Once the script loads, enter the 3 or 4 corner point coordinates as prompted.
   - Click **Accept** to confirm your selections, then click **Build** to generate the surface based on your inputs.
